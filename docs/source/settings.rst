Settings
========

Settings can be used to control the size of the screen, margins, background image, saving options and more.

How to control the settings
---------------------------

The settings can be controled by a toml config file. 

Selection of the config file
----------------------------

When the package starts it searches for a config file, in the following order:
1ยบ - local file, a config file located in the same folder as the python program that is using the package. Must be named casioplot_config.toml.
2ยบ - global file, a config file located in the folder ``~/.config/casioplot``, there may be multiple global config files, in that case the first in alphabetical order will be picked.
3ยบ - ``default.toml``, a config file stored in the package, a preset file.

You must create the folder ``~/.config/casioplot`` first to use global config files.

Available presets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package comes with 4 preset files, `default.toml`, `fx-CG50.toml`, `fx-CG50_AU` and `graph_90+e.toml`.
`fx-CG50.toml`, `fx-CG50_AU` and `graph_90+e.toml` have the exact same settings, the only reasson they are three instead of one is for better user experience.
Presets shoudn't be modified by the user.

``default.toml``:

 .. image:: images/default.png
    :alt: A completly white image

Calculator presets:

.. image:: images/calculator.png

Config file hierarchy
---------------------

Keep in mind this hierarchy that the package uses to search for config files, local > global > presets. This can be tought as the order of most custom config file to the lest custom.

Default to file
---------------

A config file may have the key `default_to`, this key is used to indicate a default to file.
If a settings is missing from a config file and that same settings is set in the default to file that setting will be set to the value of the default to file.
A config file must only have as default file a config file less custom then tham. So a local file can have a global or a preset, but a global can only have a preset file as default file.

A local config file may specify a global one that specifies a preset, creating a chain. Image that there are only 4 settings, a chain could work like this:

preset file                global file                     local file                      final settings
casioplot/presets/         ~/.config/casioplot/            myproject/

setting1                   setting1                        setting1  ------------------->  setting1
setting2                   setting2  --------------------------------------------------->  setting2
setting3  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------>  setting3
setting4                                                   setting4  ------------------->  setting4

We strongly recommend you to set default_to to a preset file in your config file. 
This will ensure that all the settings are set, so you don't get any errors when running your programs.

default_to key 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify a default to file you can use the following syntax:
- global file: "global/<file_name>"
- preset file: "presets/<file_name>"
You must include the `.toml` file extencion.

So, for example, to specify your global file named "my_global_config1.toml" do the following:

.. code-block:: toml

   # myproject/casioplot_config.toml
   default_to = "global/my_global_config1.toml"

Or to specify the preset `fx-CG50.toml` file:

.. code-block:: toml

   # ~/.config/casioplot/my_global_config1.toml
   default_to = "presets/fx-CG50.toml"

If you were to create this two file and run a program in the myproject/ directory it would have the settings of `fx-CG50.toml`.


If default_to is set to "" or isn't set there will be no default to file. If you set default_to to "" on a global file, you need to make sure that all settings are set at least once.

Available settings
------------------

.. code-block:: toml

    # presets/default.toml

    # Set the size of the canvas where you are able to draw.
    # Should not be used if `bg_image_is_set` is true,
    # since it will be automatically set to the size of the background image
    # minus the margins.
    [canvas]
    width = 400
    height = 200

    # Set the size of the margin around the canvas.
    # Useful if your background image has a border.
    [margins]
    left_margin = 5
    right_margin = 5
    top_margin = 5
    bottom_margin = 5

    # Set the background image.
    # If `bg_image_is_set` is set to false, the background image is ignored
    # You can select where you image is in the following way:
    # Use `<image_name>` to select local images.
    # Use `global/<image_name>` to select global images.
    # Use `bg_images/<image_name>` to select preset images.
    # Include the extencion in the name.
    [background]
    bg_image_is_set = false
    # use this image if you don't want to have a background image and not use a default file
    background_image = "bg_images/blanck.png"

    # Show the screen with tkinter.
    [showing_screen]
    show_screen = true

    # Save the screen in the current directory.
    # If `save_multiple` is set to false, the screen will be saved at each
    # `show_screen` call, overwriting the previous save,
    # the file name will be `image_name` + '.' + `image_format`.
    # If `save_multiple` is set to true, the screen will be saved every time
    # `show_screen` is called `save_rate` times,
    # and file name will be `image_name` + number + '.' + `image_format`
    # where number is the number of the save.
    [saving_screen]
    save_screen = false
    image_name = "casioplot"
    image_format = "png"
    save_multiple = false
    # be careful, with save_rate = 1 you can easly generate tens of thousand of images in a few seconds
    save_rate = 1  

It could also be helpfull to see `fx-CG50.toml <https://github.com/uniwix/casioplot/blob/master/casioplot/presets/fx-CG50.toml>`_.
It loks like this:
